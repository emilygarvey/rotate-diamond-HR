The starter code renders a diamond, as well as a button that can be clicked to spin the diamond. Use state to set and update the className of the diamond div. When you're done, this `App` should toggle between rotating to the right and rotating to the left (starting with the right).

1. Replace the className variable with a "state variable" that is named className.
2. Update state inside the function handleClick so the className of the diamond toggles between 'rotate-right' and 'rotate-left'. On first click, the diamond should rotate to the right.
